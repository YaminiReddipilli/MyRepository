		<h1>Programming Languages</h1>
		<p>A programming language is a formal set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. It provides a way for a programmer to communicate with a computer, giving it specific tasks to perform. Programming languages are used to develop software, scripts, or other sets of instructions for a computer to execute.
		<br>
		Key characteristics of a programming language include:
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Syntax and Semantics:</b> Programming languages have their own specific rules and structures for writing code, known as syntax, and the meanings of these structures, known as semantics.
		<br>
		<b>Abstraction:</b> They provide a level of abstraction that allows programmers to write code without needing to understand the underlying hardware details of the computer.
		<br>
		<b>Execution:</b> Programs written in a programming language can be executed by a computer, which follows the instructions provided in the code to perform the desired tasks.
		<br>
		<b>Types and Constructs:</b> Programming languages have various data types, constructs, and features that allow for the manipulation of data, control of program flow, and organization of code.
		<br>
		<b>Paradigms:</b> Different programming languages support different programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, functional, or declarative programming.
		<br>
		<b>Compilers and Interpreters:</b> Most programming languages are either compiled or interpreted, where a compiler or interpreter translates the code into machine-readable instructions.
		<br>
		<br>
		Some popular programming languages include C, C++, Python, Java and many others, each with its own strengths and intended uses.</p>
